![tests](https://github.com/software-students-spring2025/3-python-package-snake-charmers-on-a-plane/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)

Have you ever needed to waste more time? Have no fear, random snake is here! With our amazing package, you can play with a little snake that doesn't like listening to you, and try your best to hang out with it as long as possible.

=======
## Package Description

This package will open up a window where you can set the snake's speed and color. You can also summon an inputted amount of apples that the snake can eat, and attempt to command the snake to move around (it may or may not listen). 

TODO: badge

TODO: a link to your package's page on the PyPI website.

TODO: how a developer who wants to import your project into their own code can do so - include documentation and code examples for all functions in your package and a link to an example Python program that uses each of them.

TODO: how a developer who wants to contribute to your project can set up the virtual environment, install dependencies, and build and test your package for themselves.

1. Install pipenv, if you do not have pipenv installed:
